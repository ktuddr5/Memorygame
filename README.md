# Mosaic Memory Master
This minigame made by DDR5 consists of sequence memory and visual memory tests which evaluate player's ability to recall increasing amounts of sequences and evaluate image recall ability. Idea is taken from a website [humanbenchmark.com](https://humanbenchmark.com/), specifically, "Visual Memory" and "Chimp Test" and improved upon.

Progress:
1. Three image themes: "Food", "Objects", "Animals" are implemented.
2. "Order Doesn't matter" difficulty implemented and fully functional.

Future features:
1. Difficulty functionality and functionality of "Order Matters" is not yet fully implemented.

## How to install and run
1. Once you've downloaded the ZIP file from github, you should extract it to your preferable destination and open the folder
2. Click "main.html" (Since the application is meant to be a website, the entire game functions through main.html)

## How to play

After clicking "play" you can watch the tutorial video in the description tab or access it directly via this link:

Players are given a four by four grid of tiles. Each level, some tiles will be flipped. Be quick and memorize them because they will flip right back! Once they’re gone, you’ll have to guess either the formation of sequence. You can change the game mode and difficulty in the difficulty menu (However, only "Order Doesn't Matter" is the only fully functional difficulty at this point). More consecutive correct guesses will give you more points!

The formations of the sequences are not random too! Each black square you press is a part of an image and with each level the picture will get clearer and clearer. Guess what the fully filled image may be in the “Guess bar”. The images are categorized in three different themes, which you can change in the main menu “Themes”.
